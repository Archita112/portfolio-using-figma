# portfolio-using-figma

## Hello everyone, so recently I have made a portfolio design using figma.
### This is the link of my design: 
https://www.figma.com/community/file/1272238831066337419/Archita's-portfolio

## Also, this is my first project as I'm designing something using Figma 
## If you feel like I need to improve at certain points or sections feel free to reach out and share your feedback.

## This is how it looks like:)
